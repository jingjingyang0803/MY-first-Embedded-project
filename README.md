# Lego Robot Car Project

## Project Overview
The Lego Robot Car Project was a team effort to build and program a remote-controlled car using IoT technologies. The project was carried out by a team of three and involved using **C++**, **MQTT protocol**, **REST-API**, **Arduino**, **ESP8266**, and various **sensors**. The main goal of the project was to develop a robot car capable of adjusting its direction, speed, and distance traveled while integrating sensors for autonomous obstacle detection and response.

## Key Features
- **Remote Control**: The car can be controlled in real-time through a web-based interface or a mobile device, adjusting speed and direction as needed.
- **Autonomous Obstacle Detection**: Equipped with distance detection sensors, the car identifies and reacts to nearby objects. If the object is too close, the car will stop to avoid collisions and ensure safe operation. The distance threshold can be configured based on specific requirements for the environment.
- **Real-time Communication**: Using the MQTT protocol, the car sends and receives control commands instantly, allowing smooth and responsive remote operation.
- **ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module**: The ESP8266 module provides wireless communication between the car and the control system.
- **REST-API Integration**: For additional functionality and data exchange, the car communicates with external systems through a REST API.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Core programming language for controlling the car's hardware and sensors.
- **MQTT Protocol**: Lightweight messaging protocol for IoT communication, used to transmit control commands.
- **REST API**: Enables communication between the robot car and external systems for additional functionality.
- **Arduino**: Microcontroller used to control the carâ€™s movements and sensor inputs.
- **ESP8266**: Wi-Fi module that connects the car to the internet for remote control.
- **Sensors**: Distance detection sensors are used for obstacle detection and avoidance.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Install Arduino IDE**:  
   Download and install the Arduino IDE from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

2. **Set up the hardware**:  
   - Connect the **ESP8266** module and sensors to the Arduino board according to the schematics.
   - Upload the C++ control code to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.

3. **Install dependencies**:  
   Ensure the following libraries are installed in the Arduino IDE:

   - **ESP8266WiFi**: Provides WiFi support for the ESP8266 module.
   - **ESPAsyncTCP**: Enables asynchronous TCP communication on the ESP8266, needed for efficient web server communication.
   - **ESPAsyncWebServer**: Allows you to create a non-blocking web server that can handle multiple connections.
   - **FS**: Provides support for the SPIFFS file system to store files on the ESP8266.
   - **Wire**: Supports I2C communication for sensors or devices connected via the I2C protocol.
   - **PubSubClient**: A lightweight library for MQTT communication, allowing the ESP8266 to act as a client to an MQTT broker.
   - **ArduinoJson**: A powerful library for parsing and generating JSON, which is useful for formatting and exchanging data over HTTP or MQTT.
  
You can install these libraries using the **Library Manager** in the Arduino IDE by navigating to **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries**, then searching for each library by name and clicking "Install".


4. **Run the MQTT broker**:  
   Set up a local or cloud-based MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto) to handle real-time communication between the robot car and the remote control system.

5. **Configure the REST API**:  
   Ensure the REST API server is running to handle any additional commands or data exchange with the car.

## How to Use

1. Power on the Lego robot car and ensure it's connected to Wi-Fi through the **ESP8266** module.
2. Use the web-based interface or mobile app to control the car's movements in real-time.
3. The car will autonomously detect nearby objects using its distance sensors and adjust its speed or direction as needed.
4. Monitor the status and receive real-time updates through the MQTT protocol.
